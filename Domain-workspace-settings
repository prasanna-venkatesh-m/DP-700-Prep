# DP-700 Cheat Sheet
## Configure Domain Workspace Settings

Concise reference for DP-700: Implement and Manage an Analytics Solution  
Focus area: Domain Workspace Configuration

---

## 1. Domain Workspace Roles and Permissions

Controls who can access the domain and what actions they can perform.

### Capabilities
- Create and delete Spark pools
- Run notebooks
- Manage domain resources

### Exam Traps
- Does NOT enforce row-level security (RLS)
- Does NOT restrict external data sources

**Scenario**  
Limit Spark pool creation to senior analysts while allowing others to run jobs.

---

## 2. Domain-Level Data Access Policies

Enforces data security policies across the domain.

### Capabilities
- Automatically enforces row-level security (RLS)
- Applies to all Spark sessions in the domain

### Exam Traps
- Controls data access, not compute or storage
- Must be combined with roles and permissions for full security

**Scenario**  
Restrict HR, payroll, or financial data based on user or group.

---

## 3. Domain Workspace Default Resources

Defines baseline compute and storage resources per domain.

### Capabilities
- Sets default Spark cores and memory
- Prevents excessive resource usage
- Users can request larger clusters, but defaults apply

### Exam Traps
- Does NOT enforce security or access policies
- Does NOT stop idle Spark sessions

**Scenario**  
Finance domain default: 4 cores, 16 GB RAM.

---

## 4. Domain Workspace Allowed Connections

Restricts which external data sources can be used.

### Capabilities
- Limits connectors to approved sources
- Improves governance and compliance

### Exam Traps
- Does NOT manage user permissions
- Does NOT enforce row-level security

**Scenario**  
Marketing domain allowed connections limited to approved SQL warehouse and data lake sources.

---

## 5. Auto-Termination

Automatically stops idle Spark sessions.

### Capabilities
- Frees unused compute resources
- Helps reduce cost

### Exam Trap
- Does NOT enforce compute limits or security

## 6. Domain-Level vs Notebook-Level Configuration

| Setting Type                       | Scope            | Purpose                                     |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Domain workspace roles            | Domain           | User permissions and Spark pool management  |
| Domain data access policies       | Domain           | Row-level security                          |
| Domain default resources          | Domain           | Baseline compute and storage                |
| Allowed connections               | Domain           | Restrict external data sources              |
| Auto-termination                  | Domain / Session | Stop idle Spark sessions                    |
| Notebook Spark configuration      | Notebook         | Override Spark settings per notebook        |
| Spark environment                 | Workspace        | Libraries and runtime for all notebooks     |

## 7. Exam Keywords Mapping

| Requirement in Question                | Correct Feature                   |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Automatically enforce RLS            | Domain data access policies       |
| Limit compute or storage             | Domain default resources          |
| Prevent Spark pool creation          | Roles and permissions             |
| Restrict external data sources       | Allowed connections               |
| Stop idle sessions to reduce cost    | Auto-termination                  |

## 8. Quick Memory Map

Domain Workspace  
- Roles and Permissions: who can manage resources  
- Default Resources: compute and storage baseline  
- Allowed Connections: approved data sources  
- Data Access Policies: row-level security  
- Auto-Termination: idle session cleanup

---

Exam Tip:  
Domain settings = policy and baseline  
Notebook settings = temporary overrides
