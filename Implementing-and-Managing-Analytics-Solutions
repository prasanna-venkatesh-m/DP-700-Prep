1️⃣ Key Concepts

Concept                              | Description                                                                                                      | Exam Tip / Trap
------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deployment Pipeline                  | A controlled process to promote Fabric artifacts (reports, semantic models, Dataflows Gen2) from Dev → Test → Prod. | Only metadata moves; lakehouse data is not deployed.
Workspaces                           | Logical containers for Fabric artifacts.                                                                         | Roles determine promotion and edit rights; Dev = contributors, Test/Prod = viewers/admins.
Roles in Workspaces                   | Admin, Contributor, Member, Viewer                                                                                | Admin can manage roles and artifacts; Contributor can edit in Dev; Viewer cannot edit.
Artifacts supported in Pipelines      | Reports, Semantic models, Dataflows Gen2                                                                         | Dashboards & Notebooks not supported.
Artifact scope                        | Workspace scope: deployment happens at workspace level. Notebook scope: Not deployable. Domain/organization: Pipelines don’t enforce cross-domain rules. | Never assume notebooks or dashboards deploy automatically.
Git Integration                        | Optional; enables version control and collaboration in Dev workspace.                                           | Git does not lock Test/Prod—workspace roles do that.

2️⃣ Configurations / Settings for Pipelines

Steps to implement a pipeline:

1. Create Pipeline in the Development workspace
   - Assign stages: Development → Test → Production
2. Select content to deploy
   - Reports, semantic models, Dataflows Gen2
3. Set workspace roles
   - Dev → Contributors
   - Test/Prod → Viewers or Members (edit limited)
4. Deploy / Promote content
   - Promotes metadata between stages
   - Lakehouse data must be copied separately
5. Optional Git Integration
   - Enables version tracking, branch management, rollback
   - Only affects Dev; does not prevent edits in Test/Prod

3️⃣ Scope Overview

Scope         | What is affected                              | Notes
------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workspace     | Pipelines deploy artifacts workspace-wide     | Test/Prod workspace roles control who can edit
Notebook      | Individual notebooks                          | Not deployable; manual promotion only
Domain        | Organizational or tenant level                | Pipelines do not enforce domain rules; cross-tenant deployments not supported

4️⃣ Exam Traps & Tips

Trap / Tip                 | Explanation
-------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data vs Metadata           | Pipelines move metadata, not actual lakehouse data. Data must be loaded manually or via ETL.
Notebooks / Dashboards     | Often incorrectly assumed deployable. Only Reports, Semantic Models, Dataflows Gen2 are supported.
Roles vs Git               | Git integration does not replace workspace role restrictions. Test/Prod must be locked using roles.
Workspace naming           | Exam may try to confuse Dev/Test/Prod stages; the key is role assignment + promotion order, not names.
Promotion order            | Always Dev → Test → Prod. Attempting Prod → Test is invalid.

5️⃣ Visual Summary / Diagram

[Development Workspace] 
   Roles: Contributors, Admins
   Artifacts: Reports, Semantic Models, Dataflows
         |
         v
[Deployment Pipeline] (metadata promotion)
         |
         v
[Test Workspace]
   Roles: Viewers, Admins
   Artifacts: Promoted metadata only
         |
         v
[Production Workspace]
   Roles: Viewers, Admins
   Artifacts: Final approved version

Notes on Diagram:

- Only metadata moves; data must be loaded separately.
- Git integration → only affects Dev workspace.
- Notebooks/dashboards require manual deployment.

✅ Quick Memory Hooks for Exam

- “MDL” = Metadata, Deployment, Lifecycle → Pipelines move metadata and enforce lifecycle.
- Roles rule → Dev = edit, Test/Prod = read-only.
- Supported items only → Reports, Semantic Models, Dataflows.
