DP-700 – Implement Workspace-Level Access Controls (Cheat Sheet)

1. Core Concept
The workspace is the primary security boundary in Microsoft Fabric.
Everything inside the workspace (Lakehouses, Notebooks, Pipelines, Warehouses, etc.) inherits workspace permissions unless item-level permissions are explicitly applied.

2. Workspace Roles

Role Comparison:
Role       | Create/Edit Items | Run Analytics | Manage Access | Delete Workspace
Admin      | Yes              | Yes           | Yes           | Yes
Member     | Yes              | Yes           | Yes           | No
Contributor| Yes              | Yes           | No            | No
Viewer     | No               | Yes           | No            | No

3. Role Definitions

Admin:
- Full control of the workspace
- Manage access (users & roles)
- Configure workspace settings
- Delete the workspace
Note: Use sparingly (exam expects least privilege)

Member:
- Full authoring capabilities
- Can share the workspace
- Can assign roles
- Cannot delete workspace
Trap: Members CAN manage access

Contributor:
- Create, edit, delete, publish items
- Access all data in the workspace
- Cannot manage access
Best role for engineers

Viewer:
- View all items
- Run notebooks, pipelines, SQL queries
- Read-only access
- No authoring
BIG TRAP: Viewer CAN run analytics

4. What Each Role Can Actually DO

Action          | Admin | Member | Contributor | Viewer
Create Notebook | Yes   | Yes    | Yes         | No
Edit Lakehouse  | Yes   | Yes    | Yes         | No
Run Notebook    | Yes   | Yes    | Yes         | Yes
Query Data      | Yes   | Yes    | Yes         | Yes
Share Workspace | Yes   | Yes    | No          | No

5. Scope of Permissions

Scope             | Description
Tenant / Domain   | Org-wide governance
Workspace         | Main security boundary
Item-level        | Exception-based permissions
Notebook          | Inherits workspace access

Exam rule: Secure at workspace level first, refine later if needed.

6. Governance Best Practices

Least Privilege Model:
- Engineers → Contributor
- Business users → Viewer
- Workspace owners → Admin (fewest possible)

7. Common Exam Traps

Wrong Assumptions:
- Viewer cannot run notebooks ❌
- Member cannot manage access ❌
- Contributor has limited data access ❌
- Admin needed for publishing ❌

Correct Thinking:
- Viewer = run + read
- Contributor = edit content, no governance
- Member = edit + governance
- Admin = ownership

8. Scenario Decision Guide

Need to run analytics only? → Viewer
Need to build/edit content? → Contributor
Need to share workspace? → Member
Need full ownership? → Admin

“Contributor builds, Member shares, Admin owns, Viewer runs.”
