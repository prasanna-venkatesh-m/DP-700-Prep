DP-700 – Implement Lifecycle Management in Fabric: Database Projects (Cheat Sheet)

1. Key Concepts

Database Project: Declarative definition of database schema (DDL) used to:
- Track schema changes in source control
- Deploy schema changes consistently across environments
- Detect and prevent schema drift

Notes:
- Manages schema only
- Does NOT manage data

Objects included:
- Tables
- Views
- Stored procedures
- Functions
- Schemas
- Security objects (users, roles – schema level)

Problems solved:
Problem: Manual schema changes → Solution: Declarative deployments
Problem: Production drift → Solution: Drift detection
Problem: Inconsistent environments → Solution: CI/CD pipelines
Problem: No rollback → Solution: Git versioning

2. Lifecycle Management Flow

Git Repo (Database Project) → CI Pipeline (Build & Validate) → Artifact (Schema Package) → Fabric Deployment Pipeline (Dev → Test → Prod)

Key idea: Never deploy by editing Production directly.

3. Scope & Locations

Component: Database Project → Scope: Source control (Git)
Component: Fabric Warehouse → Scope: Workspace
Component: Deployment Pipeline → Scope: Workspace-to-workspace
Component: Schema Drift → Scope: Warehouse level
Component: Notebooks → Scope: Workspace (not used for schema lifecycle)

Exam trap: Database projects are NOT domain-level objects.

4. Configuration & Settings

CI/CD Integration:
- Database project stored in Azure DevOps Git or GitHub
- CI pipeline: Build & validate schema, generate deployment artifacts

Deployment Pipelines:
- Promote changes Dev → Test → Prod
- Enforces approval gates and controlled promotion

Parameterization:
- Environment-specific values
- Connection strings
- Resource references

Purpose: Prevents hardcoding environment values.

5. Database Projects: DO vs DO NOT

DO:
- Declarative schema management
- Version control
- Schema comparison
- Drift detection
- Repeatable deployments

DO NOT:
- Move or sync data
- Replicate data
- Run transformations
- Replace ETL pipelines
- Automatically fix Production data

6. Common Exam Traps

Trap 1: Schema vs Data – “Ensures tables are identical and data is synchronized” → Wrong, database projects never manage data

Trap 2: Notebooks for Lifecycle – “Use notebooks to deploy schema across environments” → Not lifecycle-safe, no drift prevention, no declarative enforcement

Trap 3: Direct Production Fixes – “Hotfix Production to resolve schema issues” → Always breaks lifecycle governance

Trap 4: Real-time or Mirroring Confusion – Mirroring, Replication, OneLake sync → None of these are database projects

7. When to Choose Database Projects (Scenario Keywords)
- CI/CD
- Dev/Test/Prod
- Governance
- Schema drift
- Repeatable deployments
- Source control

If these keywords appear, Database projects are the answer.

8. One-Minute Mental Checklist

Ask yourself:
1. Is this schema only?
2. Is Git + CI/CD involved?
3. Are we promoting across workspaces?

If yes → Database Project

9. Visual Summary

Developer → SQL DDL → Database Project (Git) → CI/CD Pipeline → Fabric Deployment Pipeline → Warehouse Schema (Dev/Test/Prod)

10. Final Exam Advice

- If data movement is mentioned → Not database projects
- If governance + drift is mentioned → Database projects
- Production should never be edited manually
