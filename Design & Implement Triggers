### Design & Implement Schedules and Event-Based Triggers (Microsoft Fabric)

## 1️⃣ Trigger Types in Microsoft Fabric

### 🔁 Schedule Trigger

**What it does**
- Runs a pipeline at a fixed time or recurrence  
- Uses **UTC time only**

**Best for**
- Daily / weekly batch jobs  
- Predictable ingestion windows  

**Key properties**
- Start time (UTC)  
- Recurrence (minute / hour / day / week)  
- Interval (e.g., every 1 day)

**Limitations**
- Runs even when no new data exists  
- No state tracking  
- Can cause unnecessary compute cost  

📌 **Exam signal**  
“Run every day at 02:00” → **Schedule trigger**

### ⚡ Event-Based Trigger

**What it does**
- Starts a pipeline when a file is created  
- Uses **Azure Event Grid**

**Best for**
- Near real-time ingestion  
- Sporadic or unpredictable data arrival  

**Key requirements**
- Storage account supports Event Grid  
- Permissions to create event subscriptions  
- Triggered mainly on **file creation** events  

**Advantages**
- Cost-efficient  
- No polling  
- Faster ingestion  

**Limitations**
- No exactly-once guarantee  
- File updates may NOT trigger  
- One trigger per storage location  

📌 **Exam signal**  
“When a new file arrives” → **Event-based trigger**

---

### ⏱ Tumbling Window Trigger

**What it does**
- Divides time into fixed, non-overlapping windows  
- Tracks state per window  

**Best for**
- Exactly-once processing  
- Late-arriving data  
- Retry-safe pipelines  

**Key features**
- Window size (e.g., 1 hour)  
- Offset  
- Retry policies  
- Watermark support  

**Why it matters**
- Ensures each time slice is processed once and only once  

📌 **Exam signal**  
“Exactly once”, “hourly slices”, “late data” → **Tumbling window**

## 2️⃣ Trigger Configuration Scope

| Item               | Scope     |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Pipelines          | Workspace |
| Triggers           | Workspace |
| Lakehouse          | Workspace |
| Notebook execution | Workspace |
| Domain             | Governance only |

📌 **Exam trap**  
Triggers are NOT tenant-level and NOT notebook-level

---

## 3️⃣ Key Configuration Settings to Remember

### Schedule Triggers
- Time zone: **UTC only**  
- Start time is mandatory  
- Recurrence ≠ interval  

### Event-Based Triggers
- Requires Event Grid  
- Needs permissions  
- Reacts to file creation  
- Cannot aggregate multiple storage accounts  

### Tumbling Window Triggers
- Window size  
- Start time  
- Retry policy  
- State management enabled

## 4️⃣ Common DP-700 Exam Traps 🚨

| Trap                                        | Correct Thinking                          |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Event-based = exactly-once                  | ❌ Only tumbling window guarantees this   |
| Schedule triggers are real-time             | ❌ They are polling-based                 |
| File updates trigger events                 | ❌ Usually only create events             |
| Time zone doesn’t matter                    | ❌ Always UTC                             |
| One trigger can watch many storage accounts | ❌ One location per trigger               |

## 5️⃣ “If You See This → Choose This” Rules

| Exam Wording                | Best Answer             |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| “When a file arrives”       | Event-based trigger     |
| “Run every day at…”         | Schedule trigger        |
| “Exactly once per hour/day” | Tumbling window trigger |
| “Late-arriving data”        | Tumbling window         |
| “Reduce unnecessary runs”   | Event-based trigger     |
| “Retry without duplication” | Tumbling window         |

## 7️⃣ Final Exam Advice 🎯

- Read for intent, not keywords  
- Time-based reliability → **Tumbling window**  
- Cost & efficiency → **Event-based**  
- Predictable batch → **Schedule**  
- Always assume **UTC**
