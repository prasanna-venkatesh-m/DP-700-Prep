🧠 DP-700 Cheat Sheet

Configure Data Workflow Workspace Settings (Microsoft Fabric)

---

1️⃣ Key Concepts (Must Know)

Hierarchy & Scope (VERY IMPORTANT)

Tenant
 └── Domain
      └── Workspace
           └── Item (Notebook / Pipeline / Lakehouse / Dataflow)

Higher levels override lower levels

Level         | Purpose
------------- | ----------------------------
Tenant        | Global Fabric enablement
Domain        | Governance & standardization
Workspace     | Collaboration & execution
Item          | Development details

Exam rule:
If something is blocked despite correct workspace settings, check Domain first

---

2️⃣ Workspace Settings – What You Can Configure

Core Workspace Settings

Enable/disable:
- Lakehouses
- Notebooks
- Data Pipelines
- Dataflows Gen2

- Git integration
- Deployment pipelines
- Capacity assignment
- Workspace roles (Admin, Member, Contributor, Viewer)

Capacity Settings (Performance)

- Assign Fabric capacity (F2, F4, F8, …)
- Affects:
  - Notebook execution
  - Pipeline scheduling
  - Concurrency
  - Pausing behavior

Performance tuning = capacity size + concurrency control

Security & Governance

- Private endpoints (network security)
- Managed identities (item-level)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

---

3️⃣ Domain Settings (Exam Favorite)

What Domains Control

- Who can:
  - Create workspaces
  - Create Lakehouses / Pipelines / Notebooks
- Isolation rules
- Governance policies
- Default workspace behavior

Why Domains Matter

- Apply across multiple workspaces
- Reduce admin effort
- Enforce consistent rules

Exam tip:
Enterprise-wide restriction → Domain, not Workspace

---

4️⃣ Roles & Permissions (Tricky Table)

Role            | Can Run | Can Modify | Can Create Items
--------------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------------
Viewer          | ❌      | ❌         | ❌
Member          | ✅      | ❌         | ❌
Contributor     | ✅      | ✅         | ✅
Admin           | ✅      | ✅         | ✅

Most tested trap:
Member ≠ Contributor

---

5️⃣ Git Integration & DevOps Flow

Required Order (Memorize)

Workspace
 → Enable Git Integration
   → Connect Repo
     → Branching & PRs
       → Deployment Pipelines (optional)

What Git Tracks

- Notebooks
- Pipelines
- Lakehouse metadata
- SQL objects

Git is a workspace-level setting

6️⃣ Common Exam Traps 🚨

Trap 1: “Users have permissions but still can’t create items”
Answer: Domain restriction

Trap 2: “Notebooks pause or run slowly”
Answer:
- Increase capacity
- Reduce concurrency
NOT networking or security settings

Trap 3: “Restrict creation across many workspaces”
Answer: Domain settings
NOT workspace-by-workspace

Trap 4: “Let users run but not create”
Answer: Member role

7️⃣ Visual Summary (Quick Revision)

            Tenant
               │
        ┌──────▼──────┐
        │   Domain     │  ← Governance, creation rules
        └──────┬──────┘
               │
        ┌──────▼──────┐
        │ Workspace    │  ← Capacity, Git, roles
        └──────┬──────┘
               │
 ┌─────────────▼─────────────┐
 │ Notebook | Pipeline | LH   │ ← Execution only
 └───────────────────────────┘

Override direction: Higher level wins

8️⃣ Last-Minute Exam Tips 📝

- Read for scope keywords:
  - “Across workspaces” → Domain
  - “Performance” → Capacity
  - “Version control” → Git
- If two answers seem right, pick the one with:
  - Wider scope
  - Less admin effort
- Expect multi-select with 2 correct answers
