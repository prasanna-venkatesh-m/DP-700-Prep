Implement Lifecycle Management in Fabric – Database Projects

---

1️⃣ Key Concepts (High-yield)

What is a Fabric Database Project?

- A database project is a declarative definition of database schema (DDL) used to:
  - Track schema changes in source control
  - Deploy schema changes consistently across environments
  - Detect and prevent schema drift

✅ Manages schema only
❌ Does NOT manage data

---

What objects are included?

- Tables
- Views
- Stored procedures
- Functions
- Schemas
- Security objects (users, roles – schema level)

---

What problems do database projects solve?

Problem                   | Solution
------------------------- | -----------------------
Manual schema changes     | Declarative deployments
Production drift          | Drift detection
Inconsistent environments | CI/CD pipelines
No rollback               | Git versioning

---

2️⃣ Lifecycle Management Flow (Exam Favorite)

Git Repo (Database Project)
        ↓
CI Pipeline (Build & Validate)
        ↓
Artifact (Schema Package)
        ↓
Fabric Deployment Pipeline
  Dev → Test → Prod

Key idea:

You never deploy by editing Production directly

---

3️⃣ Scope & Where Things Live (Very Exam-Relevant)

Component           | Scope
------------------- | -----------------------------------------
Database Project    | Source control (Git)
Fabric Warehouse    | Workspace
Deployment Pipeline | Workspace-to-workspace
Schema Drift        | Warehouse level
Notebooks           | Workspace (not used for schema lifecycle)

Exam trap:
Database projects are NOT domain-level objects

---

4️⃣ Configuration & Settings You Should Know

CI/CD Integration

- Database project stored in:
  - Azure DevOps Git
  - GitHub
- CI pipeline:
  - Build & validate schema
  - Generate deployment artifacts

---

Deployment Pipelines

- Promote changes:
  - Dev → Test → Prod
- Enforces:
  - Approval gates
  - Controlled promotion

---

Parameterization

- Used for:
  - Environment-specific values
  - Connection strings
  - Resource references

Prevents hardcoding environment values

---

5️⃣ What Database Projects DO vs DO NOT Do (Exam Gold)

DO

- Declarative schema management
- Version control
- Schema comparison
- Drift detection
- Repeatable deployments

DO NOT

- Move or sync data
- Replicate data
- Run transformations
- Replace ETL pipelines
- Automatically fix Production data

---

6️⃣ Common Exam Traps 🚨

Trap 1: Schema vs Data

- “Ensures tables are identical and data is synchronized”
- ❌ Wrong – database projects never manage data

Trap 2: Notebooks for Lifecycle

- “Use notebooks to deploy schema across environments”
- ❌ Not lifecycle-safe
- ❌ No drift prevention
- ❌ No declarative enforcement

Trap 3: Direct Production Fixes

- “Hotfix Production to resolve schema issues”
- ❌ Always breaks lifecycle governance

Trap 4: Real-time or Mirroring Confusion

- Mirroring
- Replication
- OneLake sync
- ❌ None of these are database projects

---

7️⃣ When to Choose Database Projects (Scenario Keywords)

If the question mentions:

- CI/CD
- Dev/Test/Prod
- Governance
- Schema drift
- Repeatable deployments
- Source control

✅ Database projects are the answer

---

8️⃣ One-Minute Mental Checklist (Exam Speed)

Ask yourself:

1. Is this schema only?
2. Is Git + CI/CD involved?
3. Are we promoting across workspaces?

If yes → Database Project

---

9️⃣ Visual Summary (Quick Recall)

Developer
  ↓ (SQL DDL)
Database Project (Git)
  ↓
CI/CD Pipeline
  ↓
Fabric Deployment Pipeline
  ↓
Warehouse Schema (Dev/Test/Prod)

---

🎯 Final Exam Advice

- If data movement is mentioned → ❌ Not database projects
- If governance + drift is mentioned → ✅ Database projects
- Production should never be edited manually
