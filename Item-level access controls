# 🧠 DP-700 Cheat Sheet

## Implement Item-Level Access Controls (Microsoft Fabric)

---

## 1️⃣ Core Security Layers (EXAM FUNDAMENTAL)

Security is evaluated **top-down**:

```
Workspace access
   ↓
Item-level permissions
   ↓
Object-Level Security (OLS)
   ↓
Row-Level Security (RLS)
   ↓
Query result
```

⚠️ **If a user fails at any level, lower layers are never evaluated.**

---

## 2️⃣ Item-Level Access Control (What it REALLY means)

Item-level access controls:

* Determine **who can access an item**
* Apply to:

  * Lakehouses
  * Warehouses
  * Semantic models
  * Notebooks

❌ They do **not**:

* Filter rows
* Hide columns

That is handled by **RLS / OLS**.

---

## 3️⃣ Row-Level Security (RLS)

### Purpose

* Restrict **rows** returned to users
* Evaluated **at query time**
* Uses:

  * User identity
  * Group membership

---

### Where RLS Can Be Defined

| Location                       | Enforced For   | Exam Note                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Semantic model**             | Power BI only  | ❌ Does NOT secure SQL endpoint |
| **Warehouse (SQL predicates)** | SQL + Power BI | ✅ Strongest enforcement        |

📌 **Exam rule:**

> “Regardless of access method” → **Warehouse-level RLS**

---

### Typical Use Cases

* Region-based access
* Department-based filtering
* Multi-tenant reporting

---

## 4️⃣ Object-Level Security (OLS)

### Purpose

* Hide:

  * Columns
  * Tables
* Does **not** filter rows

### Scope

* Defined in **semantic model**
* Applies to all Power BI access

---

### When to Use OLS

* Finance sees cost columns
* Sales does not
* Curated vs raw tables

---

## 5️⃣ Workspace Roles vs Item Permissions

### Workspace Roles

| Role        | Purpose        |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Admin       | Full control   |
| Member      | Edit content   |
| Contributor | Create content |
| Viewer      | Read-only      |

⚠️ Workspace roles:

* Control **visibility**
* Do **not** enforce data security

---

### Item Permissions

* Required before:

  * RLS
  * OLS
* If user cannot access item → security rules never apply

---

## 6️⃣ Lakehouse vs Warehouse Security (EXAM FAVORITE)

| Feature                    | Lakehouse    | Warehouse        |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| SQL GRANT                  | ❌ Limited    | ✅ Supported      |
| RLS                        | ❌ Data-layer | ✅ SQL predicates |
| Semantic model RLS         | ✅            | ✅                |
| Best for enforced security | ❌            | ✅                |

📌 **Rule:**
**Warehouse = stronger security boundary**

---

## 7️⃣ Common Exam Traps 🚨

❌ Perspectives = security
❌ Workspace roles filter data
❌ RLS hides columns
❌ Semantic model RLS secures SQL access
❌ Views guarantee security
❌ GRANT SELECT filters rows

---

## 8️⃣ Exam Keywords → Correct Feature

| Exam Phrase                                     | Think             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| “Same dataset, different users, different rows” | RLS               |
| “Hide columns/tables”                           | OLS               |
| “Regardless of access method”                   | Warehouse RLS     |
| “Must not see”                                  | Enforced security |
| “User experience only”                          | Perspectives      |

---

## 9️⃣ Minimal Secure Design Pattern (BEST PRACTICE)

```
Workspace access (least privilege)
   ↓
Item permissions
   ↓
Warehouse-level RLS (if needed)
   ↓
Semantic model OLS / RLS
```

---

## 🔟 30-Second Exam Recall

* RLS = rows
* OLS = columns/tables
* Workspace roles ≠ data security
* Warehouse RLS > semantic model RLS
* Perspectives ≠ security
* No item access = no security evaluation

If you want, I can:

* Turn this into a **one-page PDF-style summary**
* Run a **final DP-700 rapid-fire quiz**
* Do a **compare-and-contrast table for all security features**
