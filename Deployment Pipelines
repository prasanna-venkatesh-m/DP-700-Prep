Perfect! Let’s make a **complete cheat sheet** for **Implementing and managing analytics solutions in Fabric – Lifecycle Management & Deployment Pipelines**. I’ll organize it clearly for **exam prep** and include key points, traps, and a visual summary at the end.

# **DP-700 Cheat Sheet: Implement Lifecycle Management in Fabric & Deployment Pipelines**

---

## **1. Key Concepts**

| Concept                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                      | Exam Tip / Trap                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Deployment Pipeline**              | A controlled process to promote **Fabric artifacts** (reports, semantic models, Dataflows Gen2) from Dev → Test → Prod.                                                          | Only metadata moves; lakehouse data is **not** deployed.                                   |
| **Workspaces**                       | Logical containers for Fabric artifacts.                                                                                                                                         | Roles determine promotion and edit rights; Dev = contributors, Test/Prod = viewers/admins. |
| **Roles in Workspaces**              | **Admin, Contributor, Member, Viewer**                                                                                                                                           | Admin can manage roles and artifacts; Contributor can edit in Dev; Viewer cannot edit.     |
| **Artifacts supported in Pipelines** | Reports, Semantic models, Dataflows Gen2                                                                                                                                         | Dashboards & Notebooks **not supported**.                                                  |
| **Artifact scope**                   | - **Workspace scope:** deployment happens at workspace level.<br>- **Notebook scope:** Not deployable.<br>- **Domain/organization:** Pipelines don’t enforce cross-domain rules. | Never assume notebooks or dashboards deploy automatically.                                 |
| **Git Integration**                  | Optional; enables version control and collaboration in Dev workspace.                                                                                                            | Git **does not lock Test/Prod**—workspace roles do that.                                   |

## **2. Configurations / Settings for Pipelines**

**Steps to implement a pipeline:**

1. **Create Pipeline** in the **Development workspace**

   * Assign stages: Development → Test → Production
2. **Select content to deploy**

   * Reports, semantic models, Dataflows Gen2
3. **Set workspace roles**

   * Dev → Contributors
   * Test/Prod → Viewers or Members (edit limited)
4. **Deploy / Promote content**

   * Promotes **metadata** between stages
   * Lakehouse data must be **copied separately**
5. **Optional Git Integration**

   * Enables version tracking, branch management, rollback
   * Only affects Dev; does **not prevent edits** in Test/Prod

## **3. Scope Overview**

| Scope         | What is affected                              | Notes                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workspace** | Pipelines deploy artifacts **workspace-wide** | Test/Prod workspace roles control who can edit                                    |
| **Notebook**  | Individual notebooks                          | Not deployable; manual promotion only                                             |
| **Domain**    | Organizational or tenant level                | Pipelines do **not enforce domain rules**; cross-tenant deployments not supported |

## **4. Exam Traps & Tips**

| Trap / Tip                 | Explanation                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data vs Metadata**       | Pipelines move **metadata**, not actual lakehouse data. Data must be loaded manually or via ETL.                 |
| **Notebooks / Dashboards** | These are often incorrectly assumed deployable. Only **Reports, Semantic Models, Dataflows Gen2** are supported. |
| **Roles vs Git**           | Git integration does not replace workspace role restrictions. Test/Prod must be locked using **roles**.          |
| **Workspace naming**       | Exam may try to confuse Dev/Test/Prod stages; the key is **role assignment + promotion order**, not names.       |
| **Promotion order**        | Always Dev → Test → Prod. Attempting Prod → Test is invalid.                                                     |

## **5. Visual Summary / Diagram**

```
[Development Workspace] 
   Roles: Contributors, Admins
   Artifacts: Reports, Semantic Models, Dataflows
         |
         v
[Deployment Pipeline] (metadata promotion)
         |
         v
[Test Workspace]
   Roles: Viewers, Admins
   Artifacts: Promoted metadata only
         |
         v
[Production Workspace]
   Roles: Viewers, Admins
   Artifacts: Final approved version
```

* **Notes on Diagram:**

  * Only metadata moves, data must be loaded separately.
  * Git integration → only affects Dev workspace.
  * Notebooks/dashboards require manual deployment.

---

✅ **Quick Memory Hooks for Exam:**

* **“MDL” = Metadata, Deployment, Lifecycle** → Pipelines move **metadata** and enforce **lifecycle**.
* **Roles rule** → Dev = edit, Test/Prod = read-only.
* **Supported items only** → Reports, Semantic Models, Dataflows.

If you want, the **next step** could be to do another **exam-style mini mock test** focusing **entirely on tricky deployment pipeline questions**, including tricky multi-selects, config traps, and Git-related scenarios.

Do you want me to create that next?
