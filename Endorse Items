DP-700 Cheat Sheet: Endorse Items (Power BI & Azure Synapse)

1. Key Concepts

Term: Certified Dataset
Meaning: Formally reviewed & approved by dataset owner or workspace admin. Trusted for organizational reporting.
Exam Tip: Only owner/admin can certify. Users see a “certified” badge.

Term: Promoted Dataset
Meaning: Recommended dataset, approved for reuse, less formal than certified.
Exam Tip: Any contributor can promote. Shows as “promoted” badge.

Term: Favorite
Meaning: Personal bookmark of dataset or report.
Exam Tip: Does not indicate trust. Personal visibility only.

Term: Endorsement
Meaning: General term for marking a dataset as promoted or certified. Signals reliability to other users.
Exam Tip: Used in governance policies.

Term: Unendorsed Dataset
Meaning: No certification or promotion.
Exam Tip: Users may see warnings; not trusted for official reporting.

2. Configurations / Settings

Certify a Dataset
- Dataset must exist in workspace.
- Only dataset owner or workspace admin can certify.
- Displays certified badge.
- Can revoke certification if dataset becomes outdated.

Promote a Dataset
- Dataset must exist in workspace.
- Any contributor can promote.
- Displays promoted badge.
- Signifies recommended for reuse, less formal than certified.

Favorite
- Click star icon on dataset/report.
- Only affects your view, not others.

Workspace Governance Recommendations
- Development workspace → Experimental, unendorsed datasets.
- Production/shared workspace → Certified datasets for official use.
- Promote datasets for recommended reuse without full certification.

3. Scope: Workspace vs Domain vs Notebook

Action: Certified
Scope: Workspace
Notes: Only applies inside the workspace. Does not propagate across workspaces automatically.

Action: Promoted
Scope: Workspace
Notes: Local to workspace; signals recommendation.

Action: Favorite
Scope: User
Notes: Personal visibility only.

Action: Cross-workspace reuse
Scope: Can be achieved by publishing promoted/certified datasets to other workspaces or sharing via dataflows.
Notes: Endorsement badge does not auto-propagate.

Exam trap: Don’t assume certification is organization-wide; it’s workspace-scoped unless explicitly published elsewhere.

4. Exam Traps & Tips

Trap: Confusing Promote vs Certify
Explanation: Promote = recommended; Certify = trusted
How to Avoid: Remember: Promotion = flexible, Certify = formal

Trap: Certification scope
Explanation: Many think certifying in one workspace affects others
How to Avoid: Always check: workspace-specific

Trap: Favorites = endorsement
Explanation: Favoriting does not signal trust
How to Avoid: Favorites are personal only

Trap: Revoking certification
Explanation: Some think certification is permanent
How to Avoid: Certification can be revoked

Trap: Contributor permissions
Explanation: Contributors cannot certify
How to Avoid: Only owners/admins can certify

Memory tip: Think “C” for Certified = Controlled / formal, “P” for Promoted = Popular / recommended.

Flow for Governance Example:

Development Workspace → Experiment → Promote for reuse → Production Workspace → Certify → Official reporting

6. Exam Memory Hooks

C → Certified → Controlled / Trusted
P → Promoted → Popular / Recommended
F → Favorite → Personal Only
Endorsement badges = trust signal
Scope = workspace, not org-wide
