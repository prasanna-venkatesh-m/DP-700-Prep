Absolutely! Here’s a comprehensive cheat sheet for “Apply Sensitivity Labels in Power BI” tailored for DP-700. I’ve organized it for fast exam revision, with key concepts, configurations, scope, exam traps, and a visual summary.

DP-700 Cheat Sheet: Sensitivity Labels in Power BI

1. Key Concepts

Sensitivity Labels: Tags that classify data by sensitivity (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Highly Confidential).
Purpose: Protect data, enforce governance policies, prevent unauthorized sharing/export.
Integration: Part of Microsoft Information Protection (MIP); integrated with Power BI, Office apps, OneDrive, SharePoint.
Propagation:
- Dataset → Reports → Dashboards
- Workspace → All content inside workspace
Policy Enforcement: Enforced via MIP policies; may include:
- Prevent export (Excel, CSV, PDF)
- Restrict copy/paste
- Encrypt content
- Require label assignment before publishing

2. Where Labels Can Be Applied

Scope: Dataset
Can Apply Label: Yes
Notes: Propagates to reports & dashboards unless manually overridden.

Scope: Report
Can Apply Label: Yes
Notes: Manual labels override inherited labels from dataset.

Scope: Dashboard
Can Apply Label: Yes
Notes: Inherits from datasets used in visuals.

Scope: Workspace
Can Apply Label: Yes
Notes: Applies to all content in workspace; dataset-level labels override workspace labels.

Scope: Notebook (Synapse)
Can Apply Label: Limited
Notes: Cannot apply directly; rely on dataset/workspace labels.

3. Label Enforcement Behaviors

Behavior: Visual marking (header/banner)
Applies: Yes
Notes: Some labels are visual-only; no restriction unless MIP policy enabled.

Behavior: Prevent export (Excel, CSV, PDF)
Applies: Yes
Notes: Only if MIP policies are configured.

Behavior: Encryption
Applies: Yes
Notes: Only if policy specifies encryption.

Behavior: Propagation to downstream reports
Applies: Yes
Notes: Dataset label propagates unless report has manual label.

Behavior: Propagation to upstream datasets
Applies: No
Notes: Report label does NOT affect dataset.

Behavior: Enforcement of access/viewing
Applies: No
Notes: Labels do not block access; they govern sharing/export.

4. Integration with Microsoft 365 Compliance Center

Creation: Labels are created and configured in M365 Compliance Center, not Power BI.
Publishing: Labels can be published to Power BI after creation.
Required Label Policy: Admins can enforce that a label must be applied before publishing content.
MIP Policies Control Enforcement: Prevent export, require encryption, restrict external sharing.

5. Exam Traps & Tips

Inheritance Confusion:
- Dataset → Report/Dashboard = automatic if report has no manual label
- Report → Dataset = does not propagate upstream

Workspace vs Dataset Label:
- Workspace label applies to all content.
- Dataset label overrides workspace label for that dataset.

Visual-only labels:
- Some labels just display a banner.
- Check wording: “enforces restrictions” vs “marks as sensitive.”

Export & Sharing Restrictions:
- Labels only enforce restrictions if MIP policy configured.
- Cannot bypass by Power BI Desktop or new datasets.

Scope Misunderstanding:
- Notebooks: Labels cannot be applied directly in Power BI; focus on datasets/workspaces.

6. Quick Visual Summary

[Workspace Label]
        |
---------------------------------------
|                 |                   |
[Dataset 1]     [Dataset 2]        [Dataset 3]
     |               |                   |
[Report A]      [Report B]         [Report C]
     |               |                   |
[Dashboard A]  [Dashboard B]     [Dashboard C]

Rules:
- Workspace label applies to all unless dataset label exists.
- Dataset label propagates to reports/dashboards unless manually overridden.
- Report label overrides inherited dataset label.
- Policies enforce export/sharing, not viewing.

7. Quick Exam Mnemonics

DSD → Dataset → Report → Dashboard (propagation direction)
Workspace Wins Nothing → Dataset labels override workspace labels
Visual vs Policy → Visual-only labels are not enforcement; policies required for restrictions

This cheat sheet covers everything you need for DP-700 on sensitivity labels: scope, propagation, enforcement, M365 integration, and traps.
